## Project Overview
This project consists of **three separate programs** that work together to log, encrypt, and decrypt messages. The programs communicate via **pipes**, and the entire system is controlled by the **driver program**.

---

## Files & Their Roles
| File           | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| `logger.py`   | Logs actions into a file (`test.log`). Receives log messages via standard input. |
| `encryption.py` | Encrypts and decrypts messages using the **Vigen√®re cipher**. Communicates via standard input/output. |
| `driver.py`   | Controls the encryption & logging programs, handles user input, and provides a **menu-driven interface**. |
| `README.md`   | This documentation file. |
| `test.log`    | The log file where all actions are recorded. **This file is generated at runtime.** |

---

## How to Compile & Run the Program
python3 driver.py TheLogFile.log
- you should be promoted with a menu of commands
- all actions are logged in the log file


### **Setup**
Before running the project, ensure you have **Python 3** installed.  
Also, install `pytz` for timezone handling:
```bash
pip install pytz
